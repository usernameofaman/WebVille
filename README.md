Start time of the Task : 2:15 PM
End time of the task : 5:52 PM

I have created the Form Module, inside this we have :
    index.js responsible for all the API Calls if anything is there.
    Form.js is the form that is intially rendred for editing the form.
    TableView.js is the table view of the form after submittion.

Common Module contains all the components that are commonly used, We can import and use them.

The task is completed keeping the remaining time in head, otherwise the code can heavily optimised,
The functions used, for adding item to array, removing and modifying values in array can be optimised.
The task itself had no details data, Hence the name of the fields and data inside select box is taken randomly.
I believe the functionality part is what i had my focus on so that I completed.
